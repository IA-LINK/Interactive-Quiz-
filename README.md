Project Plan: Interactive Quiz Application
1. Define Objectives
    • Create a web-based quiz application. 
    • Implement features like user authentication, quiz scoring, time limits, and feedback. 
    • Ensure the application is responsive and scalable. 
    • Provide an option to add new quizzes dynamically. 
    • Expose quiz questions via a REST API (Bonus). 

2. Tech Stack
    • Backend: Python (Flask or Django) 
    • Frontend: HTML, CSS (with optional JavaScript for interactivity) 
    • Database: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL/MySQL (production) 
    • APIs: Django REST Framework (DRF) or Flask-RESTful for exposing quiz questions. 

3. Milestones and Steps
Milestone 1: User Authentication and Session Management
    • Tasks:
        1. Set up user registration and login functionality. 
        2. Use session management to track user activity. 
        3. Implement password hashing for security (e.g., Django's User model or Flask's Flask-Security). 
        4. Protect quiz routes to ensure only logged-in users can access them. 
    • Deliverables:
        1. User authentication system. 
        2. Secure login/logout with session tracking. 

Milestone 2: Quiz Functionality and Result Storage
    • Tasks:
        1. Design database models for quizzes, questions, options, and user results. 
        2. Create views for displaying quizzes and handling submissions. 
        3. Store quiz results under user accounts for future reference. 
        4. Add scoring logic and provide real-time feedback. 
    • Deliverables:
        1. Quiz pages with multiple-choice questions. 
        2. Results stored and associated with user accounts. 

Milestone 3: Responsive Design
    • Tasks:
        1. Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind for responsiveness. 
        2. Ensure quiz pages adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). 
    • Deliverables:
        1. Fully responsive quiz interface. 

Milestone 4: Add New Quiz Sets Dynamically
    • Tasks:
        1. Design an admin interface to upload new quiz questions and answers. 
        2. Use a form or CSV upload feature to add quizzes. 
        3. Validate data to prevent errors. 
    • Deliverables:
        1. Admin dashboard for managing quizzes. 

Milestone 5 (Bonus): Expose Quiz Questions via REST API
    • Tasks:
        1. Create RESTful endpoints to fetch quizzes and questions. 
        2. Use authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) to secure API endpoints. 
        3. Implement pagination for large datasets. 
    • Deliverables:
        1. REST API for accessing quiz questions. 

4. Suggested Database Schema
Tables:
    1. User:
        ◦ id (Primary Key) 
        ◦ username 
        ◦ password_hash 
        ◦ email 
    2. Quiz:
        ◦ id (Primary Key) 
        ◦ title 
        ◦ description 
    3. Question:
        ◦ id (Primary Key) 
        ◦ quiz_id (Foreign Key) 
        ◦ text 
    4. Option:
        ◦ id (Primary Key) 
        ◦ question_id (Foreign Key) 
        ◦ text 
        ◦ is_correct (Boolean) 
    5. Result:
        ◦ id (Primary Key) 
        ◦ user_id (Foreign Key) 
        ◦ quiz_id (Foreign Key) 
        ◦ score 
        ◦ timestamp 

5. Folder Structure
For Django:
quiz_app/
├── manage.py
├── quiz_app/
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── wsgi.py
├── quizzes/
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── views.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── base.html
│   │   ├── quiz.html
│   ├── static/
│       ├── css/
│       ├── js/
For Flask:
quiz_app/
├── app.py
├── models.py
├── templates/
│   ├── base.html
│   ├── quiz.html
├── static/
│   ├── css/

6. Implementation Tips
    • Use Django REST Framework (DRF): For creating REST APIs. 
    • Form Validation: Use Django Forms or Flask-WTF for robust input validation. 
    • Testing: Write unit tests for views, models, and API endpoints. 
    • Deployment: Use services like Heroku or AWS for deployment.
